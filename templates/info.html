            A cancer of blood-forming tissues, hindering the body's ability to fight infection.
            Leukaemia is cancer of blood-forming tissues, including bone marrow. Many types exist such as acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.
            Many patients with slow-growing types of leukaemia don't have symptoms. Rapidly growing types of leukaemia may cause symptoms that include fatigue, weight loss, frequent infections and easy bleeding or bruising.
            Treatment is highly variable. For slow-growing leukaemias, treatment may include monitoring. For aggressive leukaemias, treatment includes chemotherapy that's sometimes followed by radiation and stem-cell transplant.

              Blood cancer, which affects the production and function of blood cells in the bone marrow or lymphatic system, can cause a wide range of symptoms that often develop gradually. Common signs include persistent fatigue or weakness, frequent infections, unexplained fever or night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and loss of appetite. People may also experience easy bruising or bleeding, such as frequent nosebleeds or bleeding gums, along with pale skin and shortness of breath due to anemia. Swollen, painless lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin are also typical. Bone pain or tenderness, especially in the ribs, spine, or hips, may occur in certain types like multiple myeloma. Specific forms of blood cancer show distinct patterns — leukemia may cause joint pain and an enlarged spleen, lymphoma often leads to itchy skin and chest discomfort, and myeloma can raise calcium levels, leading to nausea or confusion. If symptoms like prolonged fatigue, recurrent infections, unexplained bruising, or swollen lymph nodes persist for more than a few weeks, its important to consult a doctor for evaluation and blood tests.

                        While there is no guaranteed way to prevent blood cancer, certain precautions and lifestyle choices can help reduce risk and promote overall blood and immune system health. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains supports the immune system and helps the body fight off harmful toxins. Avoiding tobacco and limiting alcohol consumption are essential, as both increase the risk of several cancers, including those affecting the blood. Regular exercise improves circulation and overall health, while maintaining a healthy weight can lower inflammation and reduce cancer risk. Its also important to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals like pesticides, benzene, and industrial solvents, which have been linked to blood cancers such as leukemia. Practicing good hygiene and getting vaccinations can help prevent infections that may weaken the immune system. Finally, going for regular medical check-ups and blood tests can help detect any early changes in blood cell counts or overall health, allowing for timely diagnosis and treatment if needed.

                The treatment of blood cancer depends on its type, stage, and the patient’s overall health, but the main goal is to destroy cancerous cells and restore normal blood cell production. Common treatment options include **chemotherapy**, which uses powerful drugs to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells, and **radiation therapy**, which targets specific areas to destroy abnormal cells. **Stem cell or bone marrow transplantation** is another major treatment, where damaged bone marrow is replaced with healthy stem cells to rebuild the blood system. **Targeted therapy** and **immunotherapy** are modern approaches that use drugs or antibodies to specifically attack cancer cells or boost the immune system’s ability to fight them. In some cases, **surgery** may be done to remove enlarged lymph nodes or tumors. Throughout treatment, patients are often given medications and supportive care to manage side effects like fatigue, infections, or anemia. Regular follow-ups and blood tests are essential to monitor recovery and prevent relapse. Early detection and timely treatment greatly improve the chances of successful management and long-term survival.
